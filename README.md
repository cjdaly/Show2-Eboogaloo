## Show2-Eboogaloo

This is a love letter to a great part: the ODroid [Show2](http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:odroidshow) display.  It's an Arduino with a screen! Does that sound familiar? Maybe you remember the MicroView [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1516846343/microview-chip-sized-arduino-with-built-in-oled-di).  The MicroView is another Arduino with built-in display.  In fact the Show2 and the MicroView use the same (ATMEL ATmega328P) Arduino SOC. Here is a look at both of them in action:

So does the MicroView suck? Not at all! The MicroView is a very well designed and constructed part ... but I'm not in love with MicroView (any more) ... it's an emotional thing - I can't explain it; but I'll try anyway:

<table>
<tr><th>Show2</th><th></th><th></th><th>MicroView</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><td>bigger is better - more pixels (320x200 vs. 64x48) and larger screen make for easier reading</td><td>+1</td><td></td><td>small is beautiful - it really depends on the application</td><td>+1</td></tr>
